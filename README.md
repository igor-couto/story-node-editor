**Story Node Editor** is a web-based application designed to help you create interactive stories in the style of _choose-your-own-adventure_. This tool allows you to design story nodes, insert text and choices, and connect them visualize the flow of your narrative.

I built this as a learning project to explore the [JointJS](https://www.jointjs.com/) library. The code is a bit messy, I know.

Check out the live version of the project [igorcouto.com/projects/story-nodes-editor](https://igorcouto.com/projects/story-nodes-editor)
